## ðŸ“‹ project description

boÃ®te music is a small web application that allows users to interact with a list of songs.  
users can browse, play, and explore tracks in an intuitive and responsive interface built with vue.js.

this project was made during a **tp (travail pratique)** to strengthen my understanding of vue.js basics, vue-router, and project structure.
